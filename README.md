# Shaded Maps in R

Here you find code realting to maps I created using the [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) and [rayrender](https://www.rayrender.net/) packages developed by [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://www.tylermw.com/).

Any code you can find here can be used, altered and shared. The examples are non-exhaustive and should be considered as a starting point for further inspiriation. Examplary datasets used need to be cited (check codes commentary themselves).


## Colors of Elevation (CoE)

This project aims to create national elevation maps where altidudinal gradients are colored in respective colors from flags or coats of arms from states or regions. Final labeling and additional information is added using inkscape (or any other graphical software of choice).
Example for Austria - where you find the code in this repository.
